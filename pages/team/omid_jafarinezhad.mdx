Omid Jafarinezhad is a passionate Ph.D. student in Health Informatics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), 
driven by a profound curiosity for exploring the intersection of healthcare and technology. With an academic background in computer 
engineering and years of industry experience, his current focus lies in developing a distributed AI software platform tailored for 
the healthcare domain, particularly in leveraging collaborative learning for predictive model development. 

His journey in software development began during his undergraduate studies, where he focused on improving his programming skills and delving into software engineering principles.
During this time, Omid's interests gravitated towards tools that could enhance developer productivity, such as refactoring, 
automated code generators, and systems enforcing best practices. Upon entering the industry post-graduation, 
he gained hands-on experience as a software developer, crafting data-intensive applications for desktop, web, and mobile platforms. 
This real-world exposure exposed him to the complexities and challenges inherent in software development, 
sparking a desire to deepen his understanding of industry issues and potential solutions. 
Motivated by this, he pursued further education at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_University_of_Technology), 
conducting research under the supervision of [Dr. Raman Ramsin](https://sharif.edu/~ramsin/).
Here, he explored a software product line approach leveraging fuzzy logic for situation-based software processes. 

Throughout his professional trajectory spanning over two decades, heâ€™s led multidisciplinary teams and spearheaded innovative projects. 
From his role as a tech lead at RayaCell, developing impactful mobile applications, to serving as CTO at VADA, developing and maintaining 
a high-traffic transaction platform, and then leading tailored software development at Nopayar, 
he has consistently pursued opportunities to innovate and make a meaningful impact in the software industry.

The global COVID-19 pandemic underscored the critical importance of health informatics and data science, 
driving Omid's interest towards leveraging technology for impactful healthcare solutions. 
He recognized the significance of healthcare data accessibility, distributed AI method development, and computing 
capabilities in the context of vaccine development. This motivated him to explore the viability of practical 
decentralized AI solutions focused on collaborative AI model development using diverse patient health data from different institutions, 
all while prioritizing individual ownership and privacy.
