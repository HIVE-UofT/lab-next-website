Omid Jafarinezhad is a passionate Ph.D. student in Health Informatics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), 
driven by a profound curiosity for exploring the intersection of healthcare and technology.
With an academic background in computer engineering and years of industry experience, 
his current focus lies in developing a distributed AI software platform tailored for the healthcare domain, 
particularly in leveraging collaborative learning for predictive model development.

My journey in software development began during my undergraduate studies, where I focused on improving 
my programming skills and delving into software engineering principles. My interests gravitated towards 
tools that could enhance developer productivity, such as refactoring, automated code generators, 
and systems enforcing best practices. Upon entering the industry post-graduation, 
I gained hands-on experience as a software developer, crafting data-intensive applications for 
desktop, web, and mobile platforms. This real-world exposure exposed me to the complexities 
and challenges inherent in software development, sparking a desire to deepen my understanding of 
industry issues and potential solutions. Motivated by this, I pursued further education at 
[Sharif University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_University_of_Technology), 
conducting research under the supervision of [Dr. Raman Ramsin](https://sharif.edu/~ramsin/). 
Here, I explored a software product line approach leveraging fuzzy logic for situation-based software processes.
Throughout my professional trajectory spanning over two decades, I've led multidisciplinary teams
 and spearheaded innovative projects. From my role as a Tech Lead at RayaCell, developing impactful Android applications, 
 to serving as Head of IT at VADA, developing and maintaining a high-traffic transaction platform, and then leading 
 tailored software development at Nopayar, I've consistently pursued opportunities to innovate and make a meaningful impact in the software industry.

The global COVID-19 pandemic underscored the critical importance of health informatics and data science, 
driving my interest towards leveraging technology for impactful healthcare solutions. 
I recognized the significance of healthcare data accessibility, distributed AI method development, and 
computing capabilities in the context of vaccine development. 
This motivated me to explore the viability of decentralized AI solutions focused on collaborative AI model development 
using diverse patient health data from different institutions, all while prioritizing individual ownership and privacy.
