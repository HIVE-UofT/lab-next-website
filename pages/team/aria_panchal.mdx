Aria is a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto with a double major in Physiology & Health and Disease. She is deeply passionate about holistic health and has over 3 years of experience in translational research. She has previously contributed to projects on oncological research to develop a cancer-preventive diet, conducted sleep studies to improve outcomes for apnea patients, and nutritional policy research to create Canada's first national school-food program. With a focus on data-driven decision-making and scientific communications, she hopes to engage in further health informatics projects that will help take healthcare to scale. Outside of the classroom, Aria is part of a competitive dance team and also hosts free dance classes to connect with UofT's vibrant student community.
