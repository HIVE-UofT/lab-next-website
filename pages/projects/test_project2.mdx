story:  "As articulated in the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) 10-year strategic plan, biomedical science and knowledge mobilization has a critical role in improving the health of people in Canada and throughout the world (CIHR Strategic Plan 2021-2031). Data access and informatics are integral contributors to this goal. Despite massive amount of health data (30% of the world’s data), the health systems are still information poor and prone to disparities in healthcare access and quality. In Canada, while there exist rich provincial and multi-province health data initiatives, they are limited to a specific health outcome, data type (e.g., administrative data) or health care setting (e.g., primary care), which leaves health researchers and stakeholders in the country with incomplete and uncoordinated data about patient health. We will leverage the existing foundational work in the context of health data in the country to develop standard data models to enable interoperability of the existing datasets and integrate other national environmental, behavioural, and lifestyle data (e.g., social media, digital platforms, wearable devices, CANUE, CanPath) into the health data ecosystem and enable pan-Canadian research initiatives in using these data sources for better Canadians health."

Neil Seeman specializes in innovations that empower healthcare experts, data, and evidence-based ideas in public health to deliver positive and sustained system-level impact. At the University of Toronto, he teaches at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, and is a senior fellow in the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, The Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences, Massey College, and the Investigative Journalism Bureau. His work in the private and public sector has specialized in Big Data and inclusive data: how to hear from the voices of people traditionally left out of surveys and decision-making. He champions post-partisan approaches to solving complex public health challenges and the use of complementary datasets for public policy. Neil is a regular contributor to Nikkei Asia, The Toronto Star, and Healthcare Quarterly. He has published his research on mental health topics in Nature, Synapse, and in other leading academic journals. Neil was founder and director of the Health Strategy Innovation Cell at the University of Toronto. He is the recipient of major research grants, including a New Frontiers in Research Fund (NFRF) grant awarded through Canada’s three federal research agencies: the SSHRC, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC). He is the co-author of three books on mental health, including "XXL: Obesity and the Limits of Shame," which was a finalist for the Donner Book Prize and was selected as an “outstanding” title by the University Press Books Committee. He is the author, most recently, of "Accelerated Minds: Unlocking the Fascinating, Inspiring, and Often Destructive Impulses that Drive the Entrepreneurial Brain," published in May 2023 by Sutherland House Books. Neil is a graduate of the University of Toronto Law School (JD) and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (MPH).
